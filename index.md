[Vogon Poetry](Vogon-poetry/index.html) 

According to Douglas Adams's _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ Vogons are known for writing the third worst poetry in the universe.The alien race is slug-like, bureaucratic, officious, and callous, reflected in their poetry which underscores their "essential Vogonity." 

This project uses [Tracery](https://www.tracery.io/) to generate new Vogon Poetry based on the material in _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_.
